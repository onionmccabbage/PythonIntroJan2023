# the word 'comprehension' is used in Python
# here it foes NOT mean understanding
# it means comprehensively dealing with every member of a collection

# here is a list that will contain all the even numbers from 0 to 100
even_l = [ num for num in range(0, 101) if num%2 == 0 ] # this is called list comprehension
