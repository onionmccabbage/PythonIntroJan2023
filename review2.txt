Python Review 2 until tea beeak at 3:00
===============
Ask the user for a category then ask them for an id number
(category can be 'users', 'posts', 'albums', 'todos' or 'photos')
You could validate that the category exists, maybe in a separate module that you import
Use these to make a call to an API and show the results

This is a chance to explore Python 
- Alter these instructions to suit your thinking
- Aim for good architecture (maybe use separate modules and packages)
- Look online, talk to each other, ask me etc.
There will be an opportunity to share your code at the end

Details:
Write a new module which asks the user for a 'category' and an 'id' 
(remember to use input() which always returns a string)
Validate the user input as follows:
- The category may only be one of 'users', 'posts', 'albums', 'todos' or 'photos'
  (maybe use the 'in' operator to see if the value is in a tuple of permitted values)
- The id must be a positive integer in the range 1-10 (or suitable range per category)
After you ask the user for category and id values, build a string something like this: 
  f'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/{category}/{id}'
(Note the 'format' to inject the values into the curly brackets)

Use the 'requests' library to make a 'get' call to the API
Return the JSON as a dictionary, then print what was returned

Optional
========
Use 'if' 'elif' and 'else' to print different nicely formatted strings, depending on the category

We need to ensure the two parameters are in the required form:
Write a module containing a function called 'cleanup'
The cleanup function should ensure:
- there is a value for the 'category' as a non-empty string containing one of the permitted categories
- there is a value for the 'id' as a positive integer
If category or id is missing or unacceptable, you should provide sensible defaults
For example, if id is a floating point number or a string, try to cast it as an int()

Import and use your 'cleanup' function to sanitize the user-provided data

If Time
=======
The API end-point includes a number of 'posts' for each user
When a request is made for a user, retreive all posts for that user
Ask for a secondary category
Then retrieve that category for a specific user ID and display nicely
